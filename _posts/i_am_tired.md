**I am tired.**

Usually when I am tired, I'd get over it over time. However, recently I have been feeling tired, and it doesn't leave my head. Many people then would think it has something to do with general lifestyle, but I find myself at another reason.

The thing is, adults frequently would have a similar pattern from day to day. By going to work, completing daily tasks, then going home, and to use their free time to watch TV or even play video games. For some others, it would then vary a lot because they have a full schedule on all their week days, and perhaps also taking their Saturday away as well. It is like this for many adults in the U.S., according to experiences that my parents had seen. Adults would need to be used to their lifestyle as they do it everyday, and they would have hopefully developped the needed skillset to also take care of themselves. Like cooking, ironing clothes, washing clothes, organizing, cleaning the house, and such. 

For teenagers, however, they can stay up all day and all night. Parents might not even care, which we would call them to be a permissive family. Or, some parents tend to be very strict and restrictive on their child, which is what we would call them to be a authorative family. Teenagers, especially in this generation, are very reliant on technology. I find this to be true, and my mom especially sometimes will get addicted to her phone watching short videos, but she could control herself. For teenagers at this generation, especially from my experience, is then very hard to have some form of self-discipline. So much of this being seen can be a reason why more of the people in this generation, or my generation to have lower graduation rates, but that is not the best way to set it.
