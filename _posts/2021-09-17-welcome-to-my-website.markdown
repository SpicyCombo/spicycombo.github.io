As you can see, I have based this article offed an example generated by Jekyll. But whatever, a website is a website and who doesn't like a website? It brings you much of the convinience for all the information you could access.. Technology has really changed for the last few years.
## What this gig is about
I don't really know what I will be adding to this website yet. I really just think of adding shortcuts to different things I manage, or just write articles about technology for fun. I mean, I made this website for fun too. Now, since this is much of a public website, I will not disclose much of the private information here (school, my schoolmates' Discords, etc...). So if you have any concerns, feel free to send an email to the address below (yes I own it and this entire website) or hit me up on Discord at SpicyCombo#1665 . Have fun!
