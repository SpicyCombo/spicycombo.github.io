My name is SpicyCombo. A random 13 year old nerd that does random technology things everyday. I would even screw up my own computer if I had the power to (I never screw up Win10s, but I did break a lot of Win7 and WinXP). You can *probably* refer to me as an computer geek, but I really don't like to be called that.
## More things
* I used to run MooMooSMP, but deleted it after a long, **LONG** time of inactivity
* I currently run XMC and SpicySurvival, they are the two servers on Classicube (ClassiCube is basically a classic Minecraft reborn, and we are **#notsponsored**)
## How to contact
