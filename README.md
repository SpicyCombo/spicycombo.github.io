#SpicyCombo's Website
## Introduction
Hi, welcome to the repository for my poorly written website in PHP. Yes I know,
 it might just doesn't look that good... you can go to my website at 
https://basicsurvival.xyz
##Licenses
I used some code from different websites, and I have listed them in the LICENSE.txt file.
 I also have included my own license, which is LICENSE.txt. Generally, you are free to host
 the website and modify the source code. But you must include my license and the license of 
other accredited sources so their and my work would be accredited.
## FAQ
### Why did you use BasicSurvival.XYZ for your site's domain name?
I bought that domain with NameCheap and it was used
 for an Minecraft factions server, and I didn't want to spend much money. I could
have bought another domain like SpicyCombo.com or something but I thought I'd just
keep it.
